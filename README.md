# Book Tracker

**_W.I.P!_**

This application is meant to keep track of books I've read, books I want to read, and how I've rated them.

I do hope to make this usable and have some future plans for the app. But for now, it's a WIP to have a public project to demonstrate some of my capabilities.

I'll continue updating this README as I add new features.

This project is single project that uses Ruby on Rails as the backend and React built in the same repo as the frontend.

Quick look at what technologies are used

- Ruby on Rails
- React
- JSS through Material UI styled components
